# Goals
1. I hope learn how to **read and understand Python** more naturally; I'm currently stuck using it as if I am referencing a foreign language dictionary to order dinner in a foreign land. 
2. I want to learn how to **write, edit, and curate software documentation** according to best practices. 
3. I would like to explore how to **create an open source annotation platform**, similar to [Genius](http://Genius.com), but focused on public domain academic/literary/historical texts.
